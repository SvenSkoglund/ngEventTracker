## Project Summary
This project is a full stack application that allows users to track books they are reading or listening to. This project was our first introduction to RESTful services. Using Spring Data JPA, Java, and Postman, we built an application that performs different CRUD operations on a database. The operation is dependent on the URI request and the controller routes that receive that request.
